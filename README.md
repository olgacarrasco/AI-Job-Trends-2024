# AI-Job-Trends-2024
In this project, I analyze AI job market trends from 2022 to 2024 using R and R Markdown. The project presents data exploration, visualizations and insights in a dynamic report, highlighting emerging roles, in-demand skills and industry changes. Ideal for those interested in AI employment trends and data-driven analysis.

The final HTML reports (with and without code) are available under the Releases section on the right sidebar.
