# AI-Job-Trends-2024
In this project, I analyse AI job market trends from 2022 to 2024 using R and R Markdown. The project presents data exploration, visualizations and insights, highlighting emerging roles, in-demand skills and industry changes. 

The repository contains the R Markdown file with the complete code and narrative. The report summarises AI job trends over the specified period, providing insights into job categories, geographic distribution, skill demands, education requirement and market evolution. It serves as a useful resource for job seekers, educators and professionals interested in the AI career landscape.

Two versions of the final HTML report are provided: one showing all the code chunks, and another with the code folded but expandable for review. Due to the file size, these reports cannot be viewed directly on GitHub and will need to be downloaded for full access.
